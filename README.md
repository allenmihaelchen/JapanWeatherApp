# JapanWeatherApp

This is a small App that fetchs the weather JSON and XML from the Livedoor Japan weather API and then do some data parsing.


Following are resources I used for this project.

Japan Weather API: http://weather.livedoor.com/weather_hacks/webservice
Primary Weather Area XML: http://weather.livedoor.com/forecast/rss/primary_area.xml
ASF HttpClient 4.5: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html
