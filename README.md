# JapanWeatherApp

This is a small App that fetchs the weather JSON and XML from the Livedoor Japan weather API and then do some data parsing.


Following are resources I used for this project.
<ul>
<li>Japan Weather API: http://weather.livedoor.com/weather_hacks/webservice </li>
<li>Primary Weather Area XML: http://weather.livedoor.com/forecast/rss/primary_area.xml </li>
<li>ASF HttpClient 4.5: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html </li>
<li>Jackson Library: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson </li>
</ul>
